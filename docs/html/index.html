<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><b>EnigmaIoT</b> is an open source solution for wireless multi sensor systems. It has two main components, multiple <b>nodes</b> and one <b>gateway</b>.</p>
<p>A number of nodes with one or more sensors each one communicate in a <b>secure</b> way to a central gateway in a star network using EnigmaIoT protocol.</p>
<p>This protocol has been designed with security on mind. All sensor data is encrypted with a random key that changes periodically. Key is unique for each node and dinamically calculated, so user do not have to enter any key. Indeed, all encryption and key agreement is transparent to user.</p>
<p>I designed this because I was seaching for a way to have a relatively high number of nodes at home. I thought about using WiFi butit would overload my home router. So I looked for an alternative. I thought about LoRa or cheap 2.4GHz modules but I wanted the simplest solution in terms of hardware.</p>
<p>ESP8266 microcontroller implements a protocol known as ESP-NOW. It is a point to point protocol, based on special WiFi frames, that works in a connectionless way and every packet is short in time. Because of this it eases to have the node feeded with batteries to have totally wireless sensors.</p>
<p>But use of encryption on ESP-NOW limits the number of nodes to only 6 nodes. So I thought that I could implement encryption on payload but I found many problems I should solve to grade this as "secure enough".</p>
<p>Find library documentation on <a href="https://gmag11.github.io/EnigmaIOT">https://gmag11.github.io/EnigmaIOT</a></p>
<h2>Project requirements</h2>
<p>During this project conception I decided that it should fulfil this list of requirements.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the simplest hardware, based on ESP8266.</li>
<li>Secure by design. Make use of a secure channel for data transmission.</li>
<li>Automatic dynamic key agreement.</li>
<li>Do not require connection to the Internet.</li>
<li>Do not overload my home WiFi infrastructure.</li>
<li>Able to use deep sleep to run on batteries.</li>
<li>Enough wireless range for a house</li>
<li>Support for a high number of nodes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Encrypted communication</li>
<li>Dynamic key, shared between one node and gateway. Keys are independent for each node</li>
<li>Number of nodes is only limited by memory on gateway (56 bytes per node)</li>
<li>Key is never on air so it is not interceptable</li>
<li>Key expiration and renewal is managed transparently</li>
<li>Avoid repeatability attack having a new random initialization vector on every message</li>
<li>Automatic and transparent node attachment</li>
<li>Avoid rogue node, rogue gateway and man-in-the-middle attack. <b>TO-DO</b></li>
<li>Plugabble phisical layer communication. Right now only ESP-NOW protocol is developed but you can easily add more communication alternatives</li>
<li>When using ESP-NOW only esp8266 is needed. No more electronics apart from sensor.</li>
<li>Optional data message counter to detect lost or repeated messages.</li>
<li>Designed as two libraries (one for gateway, one for node) for easier use.</li>
<li>Selectable crypto algorhithm</li>
<li>Gateway does not store keys only on RAM. They are lost on power cycle. This protects system against flash reading attack. All nodes attach automatically after gateway is switched on</li>
<li>Downlink available. If deep sleep is used on sensor nodes, it is queued and sent just after node send a data message.</li>
<li>Optional sleep mode management. In this case key has to be stored temporally. Normally RTC memmory is the recommended place, and it is the one currently implemented, but SPIFFS or EEPROM would be possible. <b>Under test</b></li>
</ul>
<h2>Design</h2>
<h3>System Design</h3>
<p>System functions are divided in three layers: application, link and physical layer.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="https://github.com/gmag11/EnigmaIOT/raw/master/img/system_layers.png" alt="Software Layers"/>
</div>
<ul>
<li><b>Application layer</b> is not controlled by EnigmaIoT protocol but main program. User may choose whatever data format. A good option is to use CayenneLPP format but any other format or even raw data may be used. The only limit is the maximum packet length that, for ESP-NOW is around 200 bytes.</li>
<li><b>Link layer</b> is the one that add privacy and security. It manages connection between nodes and gateway in a transparent way. It does key agreement and node registration and checks the correctness of data messages. In case of any error it automatically start a new registration process. On this layer, data packets are encrypted using calculated symetric key.</li>
<li><b>Physical layer</b> currently uses connectionless ESP-NOW. But a hardware abstaction layer has been designed so it is possible to develop interfaces for any other layer 1 technology like LoRa or nRF24F01 radios.</li>
</ul>
<h3>EnigmaIoT protocol</h3>
<p>The named <b>EnigmaIoT protocol</b> is designed to use encrypted communication without the need to hardcode the key. It uses <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/a/196480">Diffie Hellman</a> algorythm to calculate a shared key.</p>
<p>The process starts with node anouncing itself with a Client Hello message. It tells the gateway its intention to establish a new shared key. It sends Diffie Hellman public part to be used on gateway to calculate the key.</p>
<p>Gateway answers with Server Hello message that includes its public data for key calculation on node.</p>
<p>Once key is caliculated, node send an encrypted message as Key Exchange Finished message. A 32 bit CRC is calculated and it is used for decryption test.</p>
<p>If gateway validates CRC correctly it answers with a Cipher Finished message. It carries a CRC too.</p>
<p>In case of any error in the process gateway sends an Invalidate Key to reset to original status and forgets key.</p>
<p>When key is marked as valid node may start sending sensor data.</p>
<p>Optionally gateway can send data to node. As node may be sleeping between communications, downlink messages has to be sent just after uplink data. So, one downlink message is queued until node communicates. <a class="el" href="classNode.html" title="Class definition for a single sensor Node. ">Node</a> waits some milliseconds before sleep for downlink data.</p>
<p>In case of nodes that do not sleep (like actuators) gateway can send downlink data in any moment. Sleepy node is signalled during node registration on a bit on Key Exchange Finished message. It is set to 1 to signal that node will sleep just after sending data.</p>
<p>Key is forced to change every period. Gateway decides the moment to invalidate each node key. If so, it sends an invalidate key as downlink, after next data message communication.</p>
<p>After that node may start new key agreement sending a new Client Hello message.</p>
<p>All nodes and gateway are identified by its MAC address. No name is assigned so no configuration is needed on node. Function assignment has to be done in a higher level.</p>

<h2>Message format specification</h2>
<h3>Client Hello message</h3>
<div class="image">
<img src="https://github.com/gmag11/EnigmaIOT/raw/master/img/ClientHello.png" alt="Client Hello message format"/>
</div>
<p>Client hello is sent by node to start registration procedure. It includes the public key to be used on Diffie Hellman algorithm to calculate the key. A random filled 16 byte field is reserved for future use.</p>
<p>This message is sent unencrypted.</p>
<h3>Server Hello message</h3>
<div class="image">
<img src="https://github.com/gmag11/EnigmaIOT/raw/master/img/ServerHello.png" alt="Server Hello message format"/>
</div>
<p>After receiving and checking Client Hello message, gateway responds with a Server Hello message. It carries gateway's public key to let node calculate key using DH. There is a random 16 byte field reserved for future use.</p>
<p>Server Hello message is sen unencrypted.</p>
<h3>Key Exchange Finished message</h3>
<div class="image">
<img src="https://github.com/gmag11/EnigmaIOT/raw/master/img/KeyExchangeFinished.png" alt="Key Exchange Finished message format"/>
</div>
<p>After node has calculated shared key it generates a Key Exchange Finished message filled with random data and a CRC. These fields are encrypted using shared key and an initialization value (IV) that is sent unencrypted.</p>
<p>It is used by gateway to check that calculated shared key is correct.</p>
<h3>Cypher Finished message</h3>
<div class="image">
<img src="https://github.com/gmag11/EnigmaIOT/raw/master/img/CypherFinished.png" alt="Cypher Finished message format"/>
</div>
<p>After gateway has decoded correctly Key Exchange Finished message, it build a Cypher Finished message to let node check that key is correct. Gateway assings node a NodeID. It is signalled as a 2 byte field.</p>
<h3>Sensor Data message</h3>
<div class="image">
<img src="https://github.com/gmag11/EnigmaIOT/raw/master/img/SensorData.png" alt="Sensor Data message format"/>
</div>
<p>Sensor data is always encrypted using shaerd key and IV. Apart from payload this message includes node ID and a counter used by gateway to check lost or repeated messages from that node.</p>
<p>Total message length is included on a 2 byte field.</p>
<h3>Sensor Command message (downlink)</h3>
<div class="image">
<img src="https://github.com/gmag11/EnigmaIOT/raw/master/img/SensorCommand-Downlink.png" alt="Sensor Command message format"/>
</div>
<p>Gateway can send commands to an individual node in a similar way as sensor data is sent by nodes. For nodes that can be slept between consecutive data messages, this commands are queued and sent just after a data message is received.</p>
<p>Only last message is queued. In case Gateway tries to send a new message, old one gets deleted and overriden by the new one.</p>
<h3>Invalidate Key message</h3>
<div class="image">
<img src="https://github.com/gmag11/EnigmaIOT/raw/master/img/InvalidateKey.png" alt="Invalidate Key message format"/>
</div>
<p>After every data message from nodes, gateway evaluates key integrity and validity. In case of any error decoding the packet gateways ignores data and reply with this message indicating the reason that caused error. <a class="el" href="classNode.html" title="Class definition for a single sensor Node. ">Node</a> must start a new registration procedure in order to send data again. After this new registration node resends the last data message.</p>
<p>A gateway defines a key validity period after that a node key is marked as expired. In a message is received after that is processed normally but an Invalidate Key message indicating key expiration as reason. <a class="el" href="classNode.html" title="Class definition for a single sensor Node. ">Node</a> then starts a registration procedure but does not retry communication.</p>
<p>Invalidate Key message is always sent unencrypted.</p>

<h3>Wrong Data Counter</h3>
<div class="image">
<img src="https://github.com/gmag11/EnigmaIOT/raw/master/img/WrongCounter.svg?sanitize=true" alt="Wrong Counter message sequence" width="400"/>
</div>
<h2>Data format</h2>
<p>Although it is not mandatory, use of <a href="https://mydevices.com/cayenne/docs/lora/#lora-cayenne-low-power-payload">CayenneLPP format</a> is recommended for sensor data compactness.</p>
<p>You may use <a href="https://github.com/sabas1080/CayenneLPP">CayenneLPP encoder library</a> on sensor node and <a href="https://github.com/gmag11/CayenneLPPdec">CayenneLPP decoder library</a> for decoding on Gateway.</p>
<p>Example gateway code expands data message to JSON data, to be used easily as payload on a MQTT publish message to a broker. For JSON generation ArduinoJSON library is required.</p>
<p>In any case you can use your own format or even raw unencoded data. Take care of maximum message length that communications layer uses. For ESP-NOW it is about 200 bytes.</p>
<h2>Output data from gateway</h2>
<p>A user may program their own output format modifying gateway main program. For my use case gateway outputs MQTT messages in this format: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&lt;configurable prefix&gt;/&lt;node address&gt;/sensordata/&lt;json data&gt;</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> A prefix is configured on gateway to allow several sensor networks to coexist in the same subnet. After that address and data are sent.</p>
<p>Future upgrades could add statistical messages like message rate and packer error rate, this feature is under study now and it is now on development yet.</p>
<p>If ESP-NOW is used for node communication, ESP8266 cannot use WiFi in a reliable way. That's why in this case gateway will be formed by two ESP8266 linked by serial port. First one will output MQTT data in form of ascii strings and second one will forward them to MQTT broker. </p>
